## Wrapper for PDOK Locatieserver
The Dutch National SDI (PDOK) is a central facility for unlocking geodatasets of national importance. This is actual and reliable information for both the public and private sector.
Locatieserver is a very powerfull geocoding service. Upon request it will return the position of an adress, street, place, municipality, province, highway number, parcel or hectometer marker.
Soon Locatieserver will also support reverse geocoding. [Reverse geocoding is already available in b√®ta.](https://forum.pdok.nl/t/nieuw-reverse-geocoder-api-beschikbaar-om-te-testen-pdok-locatieserver/1544)
